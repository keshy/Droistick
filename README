This application consists of 2 parts.

1. Android client application ; This would be responsible for tapping into the phone's sensors to pick up data for movement of the paddles.
   A simple SensorListener implementation is provided to obtain raw sensor data and perform mathematical manipulation to determine
   the direction of movement of the phone. 
   Based on intensive testing we have the following results:
   a. The app works best if the phone is held along its longer edge i.e. in the landscape view and then flipped in a clockwise direction
      front and back.
   b. Best results were observed for the Nexus series of phones due to better accelerometer sensitivity. Not so great results were observed 
      for the Droid series. 
   c. Would require fast wifi. In order to refine this product we'd have to make a few architectural changes one of them being the dependency 
      on using internet for transfering real time motion control and also inducing another DB layer to save this data. (this is ongoing work).
   d. Can be imported into Palm devices as well. The sensors on the Palm Pre phones were found the respond better than any other android phone.

2. Server: 
   We used the facebook platform to provide a callback to our server enabling us to host the game in the facebook application page. 
   Our server is powered by php scripts taking care of adding and retrieving motion events from the DB. 

   We hacked a paddle game we found online which was primarily javascript. We stripped out the keyboard and mouse controls and provided
   an interface to our php scripts which would retrieve the data to determine the most recent motion event.
